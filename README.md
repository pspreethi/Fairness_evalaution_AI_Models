# Responsible AI Implementation: Fairness Metrics

This project demonstrates the implementation of responsible AI by assessing fairness in machine learning models. It showcases simple steps to measure, evaluate, and mitigate biases in AI systems using fairness metrics.

## Introduction

As AI systems play an increasingly prominent role in decision-making, it is essential to ensure these systems operate responsibly. This project focuses on measuring and addressing potential biases in machine learning models. The use case demonstrates how fairness metrics can evaluate the equitable treatment of different demographic groups in datasets.

## Key Features

Fairness Evaluation:
Implements fairness metrics to assess potential biases in AI models.
Transparent Analysis:
Provides insights into bias detection and mitigation techniques.
Practical Implementation:
Demonstrates step-by-step how to integrate fairness metrics into machine learning workflows.

## Technologies Used

## Fairness Metrics Overview

This project explores commonly used fairness metrics, including:

Demographic Parity: Measures whether different groups have equal positive prediction rates.
Equalized Odds: Ensures equal true positive and false positive rates across groups.
Disparate Impact: Quantifies whether decisions disproportionately affect one group over another.

## Results

Insights:
Detected biases in model predictions affecting specific demographic groups.
Demonstrated how fairness metrics can guide adjustments to improve equitable outcomes.
Outcome:
A machine learning pipeline that evaluates bias and integrates fairness metrics into model assessment.
